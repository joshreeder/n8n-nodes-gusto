### n8n Prerequisites
- [ ] n8n instance running (self-hosted or cloud)
- [ ] Community nodes enabled
- [ ] Network access to both Gusto API and ERPNext instance
- [ ] HTTPS endpoint available for webhooks

## üîß Installation Steps

### 1. Install Gusto n8n Connector
```bash
# For self-hosted n8n
npm install n8n-nodes-gusto

# For n8n Cloud - use the Community Nodes section in settings
```

### 2. Configure Gusto Credentials
- [ ] Add new credential in n8n: "Gusto OAuth2 API"
- [ ] Enter Client ID and Client Secret
- [ ] Set environment (demo/production)
- [ ] Complete OAuth2 authorization flow
- [ ] Test credential connection

### 3. Configure ERPNext Connection
- [ ] Set up HTTP Request node credentials for ERPNext API
- [ ] Test ERPNext API connectivity
- [ ] Verify employee creation permissions
- [ ] Test salary slip creation access

## üìä Data Mapping Setup

### Required ERPNext Fields
Ensure these fields exist in your ERPNext Employee DocType:
- [ ] `employee` (Employee ID - will use Gusto UUID)
- [ ] `first_name` (First Name)
- [ ] `last_name` (Last Name)
- [ ] `personal_email` (Email Address)
- [ ] `company` (Company)
- [ ] `status` (Active/Inactive/Left)
- [ ] `date_of_joining` (Hire Date)
- [ ] `relieving_date` (Termination Date)
- [ ] `department` (Department)
- [ ] `designation` (Job Title)

### Custom Fields (Optional)
Add these custom fields to track Gusto sync:
- [ ] `gusto_employee_id` (Data, Unique, Read Only)
- [ ] `gusto_sync_date` (Datetime, Read Only)

### Department & Designation Setup
- [ ] Create default departments in ERPNext
- [ ] Create default designations in ERPNext
- [ ] Set up auto-creation logic for new departments/designations

## üîÑ Workflow Implementation

### 1. Employee Onboarding Workflow
- [ ] Set up Gusto Trigger node for `employee.created` event
- [ ] Configure webhook signature verification
- [ ] Add employee data transformation logic
- [ ] Create ERPNext employee creation node
- [ ] Test with sample employee data
- [ ] Add error handling and notifications

### 2. Employee Update Workflow
- [ ] Set up Gusto Trigger node for `employee.updated` event
- [ ] Add logic to check if employee exists in ERPNext
- [ ] Configure update transformation
- [ ] Implement ERPNext employee update
- [ ] Test update scenarios

### 3. Employee Termination Workflow
- [ ] Set up Gusto Trigger node for `employee.terminated` event
- [ ] Add status update logic (Active ‚Üí Left)
- [ ] Set termination date in ERPNext
- [ ] Test termination flow

### 4. Payroll Processing Workflow
- [ ] Set up Gusto Trigger node for `payroll.processed` event
- [ ] Configure payroll data transformation
- [ ] Implement salary slip creation in ERPNext
- [ ] Add payroll calculation mapping
- [ ] Test with sample payroll data

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Test individual workflow components
- [ ] Validate data transformations
- [ ] Check error handling scenarios
- [ ] Test rate limiting compliance

### Integration Testing
- [ ] End-to-end employee onboarding test
- [ ] Payroll processing integration test
- [ ] Employee termination test
- [ ] Data consistency validation

### Production Testing
- [ ] Test with real Gusto demo account
- [ ] Validate ERPNext data accuracy
- [ ] Performance testing with bulk data
- [ ] Security testing (webhook signatures)

## üõ†Ô∏è Error Handling & Monitoring

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Handle duplicate employee creation
- [ ] Manage missing departments/designations
- [ ] Handle API rate limits
- [ ] Deal with network failures
- [ ] Validate webhook signatures

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Configure workflow execution logging
- [ ] Set up error notifications
- [ ] Monitor API quota usage
- [ ] Track sync success rates
- [ ] Set up health checks

## üöÄ Go-Live Preparation

### Final Validation
- [ ] All test scenarios passing
- [ ] Error handling tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied
- [ ] Documentation completed

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Switch to production Gusto environment
- [ ] Update webhook URLs to production
- [ ] Configure production ERPNext instance
- [ ] Set up production monitoring
- [ ] Create backup/rollback plan

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor initial sync performance
- [ ] Validate first employee/payroll sync
- [ ] Check error rates and logs
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Schedule regular maintenance

## üìö Documentation & Training

### User Documentation
- [ ] Create workflow documentation
- [ ] Document troubleshooting procedures
- [ ] Prepare user training materials
- [ ] Set up support procedures

### Maintenance Documentation
- [ ] Document backup procedures
- [ ] Create update/upgrade process
- [ ] Establish monitoring procedures
- [ ] Define support escalation paths

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Data Migration**: Plan for existing employee data migration from current system
2. **Backup Strategy**: Always backup ERPNext before implementing integration
3. **Testing Environment**: Use Gusto demo environment for initial testing
4. **Security**: Never expose API credentials in workflows or logs
5. **Rate Limits**: Respect Gusto API rate limits to avoid service interruption
